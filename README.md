## Objective
 This project aims to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms.The dataset provides a well-defined
 problem of classifying iris flowers into three different species based on their measurements.
 
## The project involves the following steps:

+ Data exploration and visualization
+ Data cleaning 
+ Training and testing data division
+ Model buliding
+ Model evaluation
